### Option 1: Fun & Exciting (Recommended) 🥳
**Subject:** 🧺 Picnic Surprise! We need your anonymous messages! 🐜

Hey everyone!

Get ready for our upcoming picnic! To make things even more fun, we've built a special **Anonymous Messaging App** just for us.

👉 **Click here to participate:** [LINK]

**You can do 3 things (completely anonymously!):**
1.  💡 **Suggest** something for the group/company.
2.  🤪 **Say something weird** (confuse us, make us laugh!).
3.  👤 **Write a message about someone** (pick a name and say something nice or funny!).

**No login required.** Just click, type, and send. We'll be reading these out loud at the picnic, so get creative! 😉

See you there!

### Option 2: Short & Sweet 🍬
**Subject:** Quick Picnic Activity 🧺

Hi team!

We have a fun little activity planned for the picnic. Please take a moment to submit an **anonymous message** here:

🔗 **[LINK]**

You can leave a suggestion, say something random, or write a note about a colleague. We'll read them out on the day!

### Option 3: Mysterious 🕵️‍♀️
**Subject:** 🤫 Secret Mission for the Picnic...

Your mission, should you choose to accept it:

Go to **[LINK]** and leave an **anonymous message**.

*   Have a secret suggestion?
*   Want to confuse the group with a weird fact?
*   Want to appreciate (or roast) a friend?

Do it now. We read them all on Picnic Day. 🧺

**Note for Admin:**
